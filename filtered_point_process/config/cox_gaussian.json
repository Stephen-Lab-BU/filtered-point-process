        "value": 1000,
        "description": "This parameter represents the autoregressive coefficient for the AR(1) process. It captures the amount of 'influence' of the p time point on the current time relative to the noise terms. As phi gets closer to 0, the process will emulate white noise. This terms also needs to be less than 1 to be wide-sense stationary."

        "value": 1,
        "description": "This parameter specifies the center frequency for the Gaussian-like bump (i.e., where the narrowband peak is centered). For example, if you want a slow wave, you could specify 1 Hz."

        "value": 0.1,
        "description": "This parameter specifies how wide the narrowband peak appears. For example, 0.1 provides a very narrowband peak in the frequency domain. Note that as this value gets smaller, the more strictly sinusoidal the time domain realization will appear."
